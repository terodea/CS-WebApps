# CS-WebApps : A collection of Web application for ML, DL models.

### About : 
I have always wanted to develop complete ML,DL applications where i would have an UI to feed in some inputs and the ML, DL model to produce an ouput on the learning that these models have done.

## Projects :
### Machine Learning Models : 
**Topic 1 :** 
    - [ Bayseian Network Model ], [ Probabilistics Graph Models ], [ Root Cause Analysis ]

**Topic 2 :** 
    - [ Supervised Learning ], [ XGBoost ], [ EnSemble Modeling]


### Deep Learning Models : 
**Topic 1 :**
    - [ Mobile App ], [ Music Recommendation ]
**Topic 2 :**
    - [ Keras ], [ GAN's ]
**Topic 3 :**
    - [ PyTorch ], [ XLNet ]
**Topic 4 :**
    - [ OpenCV ] , [ Bert ], [ Transfer Learning ]
